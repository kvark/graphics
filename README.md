# aitia

*aitia* (αἰτία) is Greek for **cause** — the answer to "why". This is a
knowledge graph in which **the edges carry the reasons**.

Most maps of a field give you the nodes: a list of techniques, a reading list,
a citation graph. The nodes are the easy part — GGX, Adam, LayerNorm are in
every index. What is almost never written down is *why one leads to the next*:

```
GGX        ──"can't hit back-facing normals"──▶  VNDF
LayerNorm  ──"re-centring contributes nothing"──▶  RMSNorm
```

That edge is the compressed judgment a practitioner accumulates and a citation
database throws away. Collecting those is the entire point of this repository.

Today the graph covers **computer graphics** and **AI/ML**, over a small shared
foundation. Nothing in the format is specific to those; a domain earns its
place by connecting to the others, not by being added.

## Where things live

Nothing in this file is generated, and nothing generated is committed. The
repository holds only what a person wrote; everything derived from it is built
on demand and published to the site, so the two can never drift apart.

## A node

Plain YAML. The filename is the id, so it cannot drift out of sync with the
contents.

```yaml
title: RMS Normalization
cluster: learning
year: 2019
aka: [RMSNorm]
summary: >
  Drops the mean-subtraction step and rescales by the root mean square alone.
  Matches LayerNorm's quality, which is the finding: the re-centring was
  never doing the work.
refs:
  - title: Root Mean Square Layer Normalization
    authors: Zhang, Sennrich
    year: 2019
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467
edges:
  - rel: corrects
    to: layer-normalization
    why: re-centring costs time and contributes nothing measurable
```

Eight relations, no free-form types: `part-of`, `specializes`, `approximates`,
`corrects`, `extends`, `requires`, `alternative-to`, `validates`.

Two rules the validator enforces. Every edge except `part-of` must say *why* —
that reason is the thing being collected, so an edge without one is not worth
having. And every node must carry at least one link out, a paper or a Wikipedia
article, so a reader can check a claim instead of trusting the summary.

## Node ids are global, deliberately

There is one flat namespace, and no per-domain prefixes. When two fields turn
out to use the same concept, that is supposed to produce **one node with edges
from both** — Monte Carlo integration is not one thing for rendering and
another for variational inference. Prefixing ids by domain would quietly
fragment exactly the connections that make a combined graph worth more than
several separate ones.

So a name collision is a prompt, not a problem: decide whether you have one
concept or two, and if two, name them apart.

## Browsing

Each cluster is one pannable, zoomable diagram. Every node gets a page with its
reasoned edges in **both** directions — what it corrects, and what corrects it —
along with its neighbourhood and its sources. The whole graph is also served as
a single [`graph.json`](https://aitia.dev/graph.json).

Edges are colour-coded by family — supersedes, classifies, substitutes for,
depends on — with the second relation in each family drawn dashed. Eight hues
would have been simpler, but eight cannot be told apart reliably under colour
vision deficiency, and four plus a line pattern can.

Layout is done by graphviz at build time and the result is inlined as SVG, so a
page carries no diagramming library: it renders before any script runs, and the
node links are real anchors that work with scripting off. Search (<kbd>/</kbd>)
highlights matches in the diagram and offers them as a jump list.

## Querying

The question a rendered mind map can never answer is "what connects these two
things?" — so that is the one the tools answer, across domains as readily as
within one:

```console
$ python3 tools/kg.py path diffusion-model svgf
Diffusion Model (diffusion-model)
  --extends-->
      (denoises repeatedly, from pure noise, to synthesise)
  Learned Denoising (neural-denoising)
  --alternative-to-->
      (learns the filter from data instead of hand-tuned weights)
  Spatiotemporal Variance-Guided Filtering (svgf)
```

```console
$ python3 tools/kg.py show vndf       # a node, with incoming and outgoing edges
$ python3 tools/kg.py search fresnel  # substring across ids, titles, summaries
$ python3 tools/kg.py stats           # counts, and anything left unconnected
```

## Contributing

Add one file to `nodes/`. You never have to edit an existing node to attach a
new one, because edges are declared on the node that owns them — so two people
working in the same area do not collide.

```console
$ python3 tools/check.py           # validate; CI runs exactly this
$ python3 tools/site.py            # build the site locally into site/
```

Building the site needs graphviz (`apt-get install graphviz`); validating and
querying do not.

An edge whose `why` could be swapped onto any other pair of nodes is not
carrying its weight. "improves on it" is not a reason; "photon count is capped
by memory, so bias never vanishes" is.
